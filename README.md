# Intelligent-Manufacturing-TCAD-Assisted-Adaptive-Weighting-Neural-Networks
# We propose a supervised learning model called an adaptive weighting neural network (AWNN) that combines the advantages of statistical the machine learning model and the physical TCAD model ( Aspect-ratio dependent etching (ARDE) Etching model).

The outcome of the TCAD calculation is the etching
depth, and the parameters used to predict the etching depth
are the trench width and the etching time. Apart from
TCAD, we conduct the experiment for deep reactive ion
etching (DRIE) BOSCH etching process to acquire the experiment
data. The etching patterns in the experiment are set the
TABLE 1. Pattern parameters are designed for diverse aspect ratio (AR).
same as in the simulation, and therefore, the input feature values
are the same for TCAD calculations and physical experiments.
The etching process steps consist of pattern exposure,
development, and dry plasma etching. Finally, the actual etching
depth is examined with the scanning electron microscope
(SEM). After experiment, the experiment data set will be
fed into our artificial neural network first. Then the output
result of experimental data will be combined with the TCAD
data.
